# Data Science Project: Livlina Logistics Workload Analysis

## Overview
This repository hosts a Data Science project focused on the analysis of workload within Livlina Logistics. The primary objectives of this project include data cleaning, wrangling, exploration, and predictive modeling. The dataset is organized based on the company's zones, specifically Outbound and Inbound.

## Project Structure
1. Cleaning and Wrangling:
    The cleaning_and_wrangling directory contains scripts addressing the cleaning and preparation of the dataset for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    The exploratory_data_analysis directory houses code and visualizations related to the exploration of the Livlina Logistics dataset.

3. Prediction Models:
    Explore predictive modeling in the prediction_models directory. This section delves into machine learning algorithms for workload predictions. Random Forest was used to model the dataset and make predictions of workload.

4. Dashboard Development:
    The dashboard directory showcases the development of a dashboard for intuitive data representation. Three main pages include Overview, Exploratory, and Prediction.

## Dashboard Structure
1. Overview Page:
   Provides a general overview of key metrics and high-level insights into Livlina Logistics workload.

2. Exploratory Page:
   Contains in-depth visualizations and analyses to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset.

3. Prediction Page:
   Implements Random Forest model for predicting workload based on historical data.

## Dataset Division
1. Outbound Zone:
   Code and analysis specific to the Outbound zone are organized under the outbound directory.

2. Inbound Zone:
   The inbound directory encompasses scripts related to the Inbound zone analysis.

## Dashboard Development
Code and Screenshots:
  Access code snippets and screenshots illustrating the development of the Livlina Logistics dashboard in the dashboard directory.
  
Feel free to explore each section of this repository to gain insights into the analysis and prediction of workload at Livlina Logistics.
